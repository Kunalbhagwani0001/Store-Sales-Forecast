# Store-Sales-Forecast
To contribute to the success of a business by utilizing data analysis techniques, specifically focusing on the time series analysis, to provide valuable insights and accurate sales forecasting 
## Problem Statement

Retail businesses generate large volumes of sales data across different regions, customer segments, payment methods, shipping modes, and product categories. However, this data is often scattered and difficult to interpret, making it challenging for decision-makers to track performance, identify trends, and plan for the future.

- The objective of this project is to design an interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidates sales data into a single view, enabling stakeholders to:

- Monitor overall sales, profit, quantity sold, and shipping performance

- Compare year-over-year (YoY) sales and profit trends

- Analyze customer behavior across regions, segments, and payment modes

- Identify high-performing and underperforming product categories

- Forecast sales for the next 30 days to support inventory and business planning
